## üìà Review Generation Steps

1. **Load & Scan IMDb**

   - Pulls the first 1,000 IMDb reviews and searches for mentions of your movie title.
   - Counts up to 5 sentiment-labeled hits (positive vs. negative).

2. **Build a Structured Prompt**

   - Embeds the following factual details:
     - **Director**
     - **Cast**
     - **Genre**
     - **Plot**
   - Includes the calculated sentiment phrase.
   - Follows a strict 4-point format:
     1. **Quick Synopsis**
     2. **Key Highlights**
     3. **Theme & Takeaway** (with sentiment)
     4. **Final Score** (out of 5‚òÖ)

3. **Generate Review via LLM**

   - Sends the prompt into a HuggingFace text-generation pipeline configured with the model and sampling hyper parameters.

4. **Clean & Validate**

   - Trims extraneous whitespace.
   - Splits output into sentences and keeps the first 3 substantial ones.
   - Ensures at least a fallback sentence if generation fails.

5. **Sentiment Classification**
   - Feeds the final review back into your sentiment-analysis pipeline.
   - Returns a JSON response:
